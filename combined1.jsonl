No beaches. \nSusan: why would you go to Italy and not have a beach?\nBill: we wanted to be away from the crowds. place had a pool and it was drivable everywhere interesing.

Then, when the costume activity has ended (which I would like to point out, doesn't depend on me but on the participants of said activity), you can rejoin us.\nJulia: Well, we don't exactly understand what the game is...

I'm sorry for all the trouble we've caused you and thank you for explaining everything.\nAurore: It's okay (nature of the job, I suppose). But are you sure?
